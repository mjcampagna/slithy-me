# Intro to Front End

You've completed a JavaScript bootcamp, like [Hack Reactor](https://www.galvanize.com/explore-hack-reactor-coding-bootcamps/), but you're not feeling data structures, and you think that maybe, just maybe, front end might be your jam. The problem is that your 12-week-or-so full stack training has left your front end experience full of holes ...

You don't know what you don't know, but you're in the right place. While plenty of Medium posts will happily walk you through building a React to-do list, few offer a holistic view into front end engineering.

Through the course of this brief workshop, we'll build React components while introducing you to the underlying concepts and technologies that should help to backfill those holes, while also providing context, and some direction where to go next.

This is not a tutorial, but a primer; your bridge from bootcamp to the larger field of front end engineering.

## Who am I?

I have been an independent web-developer for more than a decade, and in 2018 attended Hack Reactor's JavaScript bootcamp to help ease my transition into professional engineering. I have been working as a front end software enginer for San Francisco startups ever since. [Find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjcampagna/).

## Is A.I. is killing front end development?

No, I really don't think so. And neither does Josh Comeau, author of this nice article full of reasons that you should't think so either:

If anything, I think hallucinations are another contagion having jumped species from machine to human, and Twitter is a powerful transmission vector for fear and nonsense.

Whatever future may be wrought by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, the fundamentals will remain the same, and you'll be well-equipped by parse the machines' output by learning them. Therefore, on to the fundamentals ...

## The Three Pillars

The three pillars on which all of front end engineering stand are:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Presumably, you've got a handle on JavaScript by now. In my personal experience with bootcamps and bootcamp graduates, however, you are likely under-prepared in HTML and CSS.

As a front end engineer, you are expected to be a front end _specialist_. Competancy, if not mastery, in HTML and CSS is nonnegotiable.

That said, we'll put a pin in this particular deficiency, and return to it in our first exercise.

## A word on frameworks

Frameworks -- Bootstrap, Material UI, etc. -- are often used to quickly prototype an app. For that purpose, they are ... fine ... I guess. Back end and full stack engineers tend to overrely on them.

As a front end engineer, frameworks are a crutch that prevents you learning the basic skills of your craft. They can be useful as reference: understand them, what they're doing and why they're doing it, but _don't use them_. Never use them.

## Recap

We now know ...

- ... that A.I. is unlikely to crush our career aspirations.
- ... that CSS, HTML and JS are the fundamental pillars of front end.
- ... that overreliance on frameworks can hinder us.
